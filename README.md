# axiom
principia engine 2

This is a Complete yet not really totally complete rewrite of my Principia Engine
This time it is ECS from the ground up using FLECS. Every Aspect of the engine is using flecs
It also uses namespaces instead of classes
Folder structure is Components/Systems instead of include/src (probably a bad idea but hey lets experiment)
It's also my first official attempt at using cmake which i totally hate and suck at but thanks to chatgpt its some-what bareable now

Update: Yay sponza loads!!
